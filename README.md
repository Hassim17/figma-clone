🖌️ figma-clone
A simplified Figma-style collaborative design tool built with Next.js, Liveblocks, and Fabric.js.
Supports real-time multiplayer editing, cursor presence, comment threads, and basic shape drawing — built purely for learning and experimentation.

✨ Features
🟦 Create and manipulate canvas objects (shapes, elements).

🎛️ View and edit properties of selected canvas items.

👥 Real-time multiplayer collaboration across users.

💬 Add comments, emojis, and mention other users.

⚡ Instant updates for all actions across sessions using Liveblocks.

📚 Layer listing and management (like Figma).

😄 Express reactions (e.g., emojis, presence indicators) across users.

🧩 Built to mimic Figma's core interaction mechanics.
